# Advent of Code 2025

This repository includes my [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) code for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about).

*If you want to solve the puzzles yourself first, do so, **then** look for the solution to compare.*
Do **not** cheat yourself out of a great time and learning experience by just copying code!

**Please keep in mind most of this is hacked together.
I don't claim it's perfect code or even in all cases 100% valid/defined/proper code or whatever.
It's for fun and it got the job done in a short amount of time.** 😀

I'll update this repository now and then to include all my solutions whenever I've got time to properly comment and upload it.

This is mostly for those that are curious.
If you want to look at the code, experiment with it, change it, etc. be my guest.

## Preparation

To install all dependencies, run the following command (this requires `yarn` to be installed, obviously):

```bash
yarn install
```

## Running from command line

To run the code for any given day, use the following line (replacing `1` with the number of the desired day):

```bash
./day 1
```

Inputs are expected to be in the `data` sub folder relative to the current working directory.
